🧠 MEMOIZATION

A simple project demonstrating how memoization works in React/React Native to optimize performance and avoid unnecessary re-renders.

🚀 Features

- Uses `React.memo` to memoize components
- Applies `useCallback` to memoize functions
- Implements `useMemo` for computationally expensive calculations
- Includes example use cases in a working UI

🛠️ Technologies Used

- React Native
- JavaScript / JSX
- Expo 
- Functional components with Hooks

🧠 Why Memoization?

Memoization improves performance by storing previously computed results and returning them when the same inputs occur again. In UI development, it helps reduce unnecessary re-renders.

💡 How to Run

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/arjfc/MEMOIZATION.git

# Navigate to the folder
cd MEMOIZATION

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the project (React Native Expo)
npx expo start
